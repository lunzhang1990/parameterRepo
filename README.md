This is the complete code for 3, 4 inputs. The 5 and 6 input cases can be done similarly by using the code for 4 inputs by changing them to the specific logic type, and we have not provided them here. 5 and 6 cases takes much longer time than 4 case and is recommended to compute distributedly with respect to pre order restrctions over server.
