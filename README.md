This is the complete code for 3, 4 inputs. The 5 and 6 input cases can be done similarly by using the code for 4 inputs by changing them to the specific logic type. 5 and 6 cases takes much long time then 4 case and is recommended to compute distributedly with respect to pre order restrctions over server.
